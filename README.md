# stacking-bidirectional-LSTM
This model is an integrated stacking version using 3 bidirectional LSTM and 1 Meta bidirectional LSTM

It is an integrated stacking model using https://machinelearningmastery.com/stacking-ensemble-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/ 
as baseline

This model is using 3 bidirectional LSTM models for submodel and 1 bidirectional LSTM model for meta learner

You must modify data preparation part and some input shapes to fit to your own data
